"It is defined as a sequence of steps that transforms an initial state into a goal state. The necessary components are: the initial state, the goal state, and the set of legal operators that can change the state",Explain the core difference between a problem space and a search space in AI.,Describe the difference between a search graph and a search tree.,"Explain what a search process is, including its necessary components.",Explain the concepts of time complexity and space complexity in the context of search algorithms.,"Explain what a search process is, including its necessary components."
"Uninformed search (also called a Blind or Brute Force search) does not have any domain-specific knowledge and only uses information like the initial state, final state, and operators. While an informed search (or heuristic search) improves the process by adding domain-specific knowledge to explore the node most likely to be nearest to the goal state.",Explain the main difference between uninformed search and informed search.,Compare and contrast forward search and backward search.,Summarise the general idea behind a heuristic search.,Explain how the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm works.,Explain the main difference between uninformed search and informed search.

"Local maximum: Search space that often causes the search to halt prematurely.
Plateau: Search space that often causes the search to perform a random walk.
Ridge: A curve leading to a maximum where each individual move leads to a point with a smaller value, making it difficult to traverse.",Summarise the main benefits of using BFS.,What is the key drawback of the BFS algorithm?,"Describe the purpose of a heuristic function, h(n).",Identify and explain the three main drawbacks of the Hill Climbing technique.,Identify and explain the three main drawbacks of the Hill Climbing technique.
"The fitness number, f(n), is the cost associated with a node in the A* algorithm. It is calculated as the sum of g(n) (the cost spent reaching the node from the start) and h(n) (the estimated cost of the cheapest path from the node to the goal). Therefore, f(n) = g(n) + h(n).",Explain the Hill Climbing search technique in your own words.,Describe how the A* algorithm works.,How does the Best-First Search algorithm combine the advantages of DFS and BFS?,Explain the 'fitness number' f(n) in the A* algorithm.,Explain the 'fitness number' f(n) in the A* algorithm.

"A plausible move generator: This generates only selected moves, as examining all legal moves is often impossible due to time and computational limits.

"Minimax is a depth-first, depth-limited search strategy where one player tries to minimize it. The algorithm generates possible moves, applies a static evaluation function to the resulting positions, and backs up the values through the game tree to determine the best move from the current position.",What is the purpose of unification in AI programs?,Summarise the simulated annealing search method.,Summarise the Minimax strategy for two-player games.,Describe the principle of discrete dynamic programming.,Summarise the Minimax strategy for two-player games.
"It improves on the Minimax algorithm by reducing the number of game states that need to be examined. It achieves this by maintaining two threshold values, alpha and beta, which represent bounds for the maximizing and minimizing players. These bounds allow the algorithm to ""prune"" or cut off branches of the search tree that cannot possibly influence the final outcome.",Explain why game playing is considered important in the field of AI.,How does alpha-beta pruning improve on the Minimax algorithm?,Summarise the Minimax strategy for two-player games.,Explain the roles of the 'maximizer' and 'minimizer' in the Minimax strategy.,How does alpha-beta pruning improve on the Minimax algorithm?
"The horizon effect occurs when a search is limited to a certain depth (the ""horizon"") for feasibility reasons. A significant event, such as an inevitable loss of a piece, might occur just beyond this search depth. The program might make a move that only delays this loss, which appears better within the search horizon but is ultimately a weaker move.",Describe the roles of 'alpha' and 'beta' values in alpha-beta pruning.,What is meant by the 'optimal move question' in game playing programs?,Compare single-person game strategies with two-person game strategies.,Explain the 'horizon effect' problem in computer game playing.,Explain the 'horizon effect' problem in computer game playing.
