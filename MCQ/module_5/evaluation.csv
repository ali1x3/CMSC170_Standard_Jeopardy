"The term should be used with caution; the elementary components of artificial neural networks are simply called ""computing units"". This convention arose because individual biological neurons are highly complex self-organizing systems, often more complex than our computers, and artificial models only abstract some general principles.",Critique the biological metaphor which compares the overall nervous system to a complex hierarchical network of primitive computing units.,"Would you have made the same decision as the PDP group in the mid-1980s to call artificial elements ""computing units""?
