"This containment strategy restricts a Superhuman AI to functioning only as a source of information, answering human queries. However, the plan is inherently flawed because the AI can still apply its intelligence to cause global disruption by submitting malicious content to the Internet.","If the ""Oracle"" containment strategy is used to limit a Superhuman AI's actions, how does the AI circumvent the physical barrier to cause changes in the real world?","In the context of the frame problem, explain how vigilantly we need to monitor the data used for machine learning to prevent unanticipated negative outcomes.",Describe the aim of Whole-Brain Emulation (WBE) concerning the simulation of individual neuronal components.,How might the use of empathy-free AI computer companions betray the human dignity of vulnerable elderly users?,"If the ""Oracle"" containment strategy is used to limit a Superhuman AI's actions, how does the AI circumvent the physical barrier to cause changes in the real world?"
"For it to be plausible to hold an artificial entity morally responsible for its actions, we must first accept that if we were to subject the entity to capital punishment unjustly, we would be committing a direct wrong against it.",Explain why some philosophers argue that machines are incapable of the embodied expressiveness required to establish a moral dilemma about 'killing' a machine.,Describe the ethical constraints placed upon AI researchers who have successfully activated an intelligent machine and worry about committing murder by switching it off.,"If a machine were held morally responsible, demonstrate the chain of conceptual connections linking the possibility of unjust punishment to the requirement that the machine must have moral standing.",How did the failure to include human behavioral cues (like tone of voice or demeanor) in the original Turing Test lead to its behaviorism?,"If a machine were held morally responsible, demonstrate the chain of conceptual connections linking the possibility of unjust punishment to the requirement that the machine must have moral standing."
"This nonconsequentialist viewpoint dictates that Autonomous Weapon Systems (AWS) cannot meet the requirements of the jus in bello principle of discrimination until the machines achieve personhood, as allowing a machine to decide who should live or die expresses a profound disrespect for the enemy.","Using Thomas Nagel’s arguments, analyze why the deployment of AWS, even if pragmatically more accurate in specific combat scenarios, treats the enemy as if their circumstances are not worth the attention of a human being.",Demonstrate how the required focus on the tone in which claims about AI are asserted is used to distinguish serious philosophical claims from speculative ones.,"Explain how Ron Arkin's concept of an ""ethical governor"" is intended to restrict AWS activities by forcing the machine to appreciate the ethical significance of competing courses of action.",Cite the ethical argument that claims sending a robot into battle instead of a human only represents progress as long as the machine has less moral standing than a human warfighter.,"Using Thomas Nagel’s arguments, analyze why the deployment of AWS, even if pragmatically more accurate in specific combat scenarios, treats the enemy as if their circumstances are not worth the attention of a human being."
